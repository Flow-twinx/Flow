Run commands directly from your shell without entering interactive mode.
Play-like commands (`-pl`, `-rd`) automatically run in background.

```bash
flow -pl never gonna give you up    # play (auto-bg)
flow -rd daft punk                  # radio (auto-bg)
flow -sh daft punk                  # search (show results, exit)
flow -kill                          # kill VLC
flow --play-off dil                 # play a local song (offline, auto-bg)
flow --radio-off                    # radio over shuffled local library (auto-bg)
flow --resume                       # replay last track from status.json (auto-bg)
```

Also works with positional commands:

```bash
flow play never gonna give you up
flow radio daft punk
flow search daft punk
```
