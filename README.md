## Overview

Flow is a terminal music player with two modes. **Online mode** streams from
YouTube (through `yt-dlp` and VLC) and JioSaavn. **Offline mode** plays the
songs you have already downloaded. Flow checks your connection on startup and
picks the right mode for you; `switch` flips it whenever you like.

Everything Flow stores (downloads, likes, playlists, history, settings) lives
in a single folder, `~/.flow/`, and is shared by every interface. Like a song
in the TUI and it is liked in the web GUI and the shell too.

## Features

**Playback**
- Automatic online/offline detection with a manual `switch`
- YouTube search and streaming, radio mixes and JioSaavn (`savan`)
- Offline library with search, tab completion and liked songs
- Repeat (`-r [n]`), shuffle (`-s`) and background play (`-bg`)
- Audio-reactive spectrum visualizer, or synced lyrics, while a track plays

**Library**
- Downloads from YouTube (`-d`) as webm, opus, m4a or mp3
- Playlists: create, edit, merge, dedupe, reorder, and export or import `.m3u`
- Like and unlike, with optional auto-download on like
- Play counts in both modes, `flow summary` in the CLI and a History panel in the web GUI
- Rename a misspelt title once and every surface, lyrics search included, uses the new name
- Play by tag: `lang punjabi` or `artist karan` plays matching songs from your library

**Lyrics**
- Synced lines from [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net), with YouTube Music as a fallback
- Printed in the terminal in `lyrics` display mode, or scrolled with the track in the web GUI

**Interfaces**
- An interactive CLI shell, a full-screen TUI and a local web GUI
- `flow-min`, a plain non-interactive CLI for scripts, ssh and agents (see below)

**Extensible**
- Community plugins that run as isolated processes and talk to Flow through a typed, host-validated API

## Interfaces

| Command    | What it is                                                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flow`     | Interactive shell with commands, tab completion and one-shot playback flags |
| `flow-tui` | Full-screen [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io) UI with a track list and Now Playing panel |
| `flow-web` | Local web GUI served on `127.0.0.1`, on the first free port from 5000 to 5005 |
| `flow-min` | Plain output, no colour, spinner or prompt: one line or one `--json` document per command, documented exit codes, safe in pipes |

All four share the same library and settings, and playback control works
across them: `flow-min next` skips a track started from the shell, the TUI or
the web GUI. See [Interfaces](docs/user/interface.md) for how to use the TUI
and web GUI.

## Requirements

- **Linux or macOS.** Flow uses Unix-only APIs, so on Windows run it under WSL.
- **Python 3.14+**
- **[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)**, used through `python-vlc` for all audio playback
- **ffmpeg** (optional), only needed to download in a format other than webm
- **git** (optional), only needed to install plugins

## Installation

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install flow-twinx
flow
```

From source, with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flow-twinx/flow.git
cd flow
uv sync            # or: pip install .
uv run flow
```

Check that your environment is ready:

```bash
flow --check
```

This prints a pass/fail table for ffmpeg, VLC, yt-dlp and the other core
dependencies. There is no setup step: Flow creates `~/.flow/` on demand. More
detail is in [Installation](docs/user/installation.md).

## Quick start

```bash
flow -pl "never gonna give you up"        # stream from YouTube (foreground)
flow -pl "never gonna give you up" -bg    # ...in the background
flow -sh "daft punk"                      # search and show results
flow --play-off "my song"                 # play from the local library
flow --radio-off                          # shuffle-loop the whole library
flow                                      # interactive shell (type `help`)
flow-tui                                  # full-screen TUI
flow-web                                  # web GUI at http://127.0.0.1:5000
flow-min status --json                    # one JSON document, script-friendly
```

`-pl` and `-sh` are built-in shortcuts for `play` and `search`. You can add
your own with the `short` command (see [Command line](docs/user/command-line.md)).

Playback control works across interfaces, from any terminal:

```bash
flow --status      # show the current track
flow --pause       # play/pause the running player
flow --next        # skip
flow --seek 30     # seek 30 seconds forward
```

Inside the shell, `help` lists every command and `help -i` explains them in
detail. The full reference is in [Command line](docs/user/command-line.md).

## Plugins

Plugins are small programs installed from git repositories. They run in their
own processes and use only the `flow_api` module, which Flow provides, to read
the current track, control playback and change a safe set of settings.

```bash
flow plugins list              # browse available plugins
flow install <name>            # install by name
flow install owner/repo        # install from GitHub
flow run <name>                # run in the background (-t for foreground)
flow plugin kill <name>        # stop a running plugin
```

Read the [user guide](docs/user/plugins.md) to use plugins, or the
[developer guide](docs/dev/plugins.md) to write one.

## Documentation

- **[User guide](docs/user/index.md)**: commands and flags, TUI and web usage, configuration and storage, plugins
- **[Developer guide](docs/dev/index.md)**: architecture, online and offline internals, storage schemas, the control protocol, interfaces

## Development

```bash
uv sync                    # install dependencies
uv run flow --check        # verify the environment
uv run pytest              # run the test suite
```

The tests run against a scratch `HOME`, so they never touch your real
`~/.flow/`. The backend in `backend/` owns all logic; the `cli/`, `tui/`,
`web/` and `minimal/` packages are thin front ends over it. Read
