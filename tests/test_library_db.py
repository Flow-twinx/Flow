"""Storage tests for `library.db` and `history.db`.

Both are SQLite, and both are the only place play state lives, so these cover
the three things that are easy to get wrong:

* the public dict-shaped API survives the move off `library.json`,
* a play count outlives an unlike / delete (the row is only dropped when
  nothing at all is left to remember), and
* online and offline playback are counted in `library.db` but only online
  playback is logged as an event in `history.db`,
* a user rename (`library.rename`) outranks whatever metadata a later
  download or refresh writes, and the web route that exposes it.

Tests share the scratch `HOME` from `conftest.py`, and both modules resolve
their paths at import time, so every test uses video ids unique to itself.
