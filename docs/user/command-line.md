# Command line

`flow` has three personalities:

1. **Interactive shell** — run `flow` with no arguments to get a prompt.
2. **One-shot flags** — `flow --play "song"`, `flow --status`, `flow --summary`, control flags, etc.
3. **Shell-mode commands** — `flow <command> <args>` runs a single command and exits.

There is also a fourth front end, [`flow-min`](#flow-min-plain-non-interactive), for
scripts, ssh sessions and agents.

## One-shot flags

| Flag                | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `-d`                | Download the played song                                                  |
| `--play <name>`     | Play a song from YouTube                                                  |
| `--play-off <name>` | Play from the local library without going online (auto-background)        |
| `--rd <name>`       | Radio mix from YouTube (auto-background)                                  |
| `--radio-off`       | Radio over the shuffled local library (auto-background)                   |
| `--resume`          | Resume the last played track from `~/.flow/status.json` (auto-background) |
| `--pause`           | Toggle play/pause in the running player (VLC, TUI, or web)                |
| `--next`            | Skip to the next track in the running player                              |
| `--previous`        | Go back to the previous track in the running player                       |
| `--seek SEC`        | Seek SEC seconds forward in the running player                            |
| `--seekb SEC`       | Seek SEC seconds backward in the running player                           |
| `--status`          | Print the playback status card and exit                                   |
| `--summary`         | Play statistics; see [summary](#summary) below                            |
| `--like`            | Like the currently playing song (requires an active player)               |
| `--unlike`          | Unlike the currently playing song                                         |
| `--download`        | Download the currently playing song                                       |
| `--setup-island`    | Install the Hyprland music island into `~/.config/quickshell`             |
| `--check`           | Check all dependencies                                                    |

`-bg`, `-s`, `-r`, `-d`, and `-m` are also accepted inline at the end of
shell-mode commands, e.g. `flow play daft punk -s -r 3`. Single-letter flags
combine, so `-dm` is the same as `-d -m` (`-ms`, `-dms` work too).

### Multi-select (`-m`)

`-m` turns the result picker into a checkbox so you can act on several results
at once. Without `questionary` installed the picker falls back to a prompt where
you type `1,3,5-7`, `1-`, `-3`, or `all`.

| Command                          | Result                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `flow download <query> -m`       | download every ticked track            |
| `flow search <query> -dm`        | download every ticked track            |
| `flow play <query> -dm`          | download every ticked track, then play |
| `flow search <query> -m`         | play the ticked tracks as a queue      |
| `flow play <query> -m`           | play the ticked tracks as a queue      |
| `flow play <query> -m` (offline) | play the ticked songs as a queue       |

Queued playback wires up next/prev between the selected tracks, and `-r` still
repeats the queue.

## Shell mode

Run a command from your shell without entering interactive mode. When the
command plays music it stays in the foreground — like the interactive shell —
unless it backgrounds itself:

- `radio`, `savan`, `--rd`, `--radio-off`, `--play-off`, and `--resume`
  automatically spawn a background player and return to the shell.
- Everything else (`play`, `--play`, `-pl ...`) plays in the foreground;
  add `-bg` to background it, e.g. `flow play daft punk -bg`.

```bash
flow play never gonna give you up     # foreground playback
flow play never gonna give you up -bg # background playback
flow search daft punk          # print results, exit
flow radio daft punk           # radio mix (auto-bg)
flow playlist list
flow plist list                 # plist is the playlist alias
```

The control flags above (`--pause`, `--next`, `--previous`, `--seek`,
`--seekb`, `--like`, `--unlike`, `--download`, `--status`) talk to whatever
player is currently running — a background VLC, the TUI, or the web player —
and work whether or not a `flow` session is active.

### Shortcuts

Shell-mode and interactive commands accept your user-defined shortcuts as
aliases, with a `-` prefix:

```bash
flow -pl never gonna give you up    # pl -> play (foreground; add -bg for background)
flow -rd daft punk                  # rd -> radio (auto-bg)
flow -sh daft punk                  # sh -> search
flow -svn hello                     # svn -> savan (auto-bg)
flow -dl never gonna give you up    # dl -> download
```

Built-in aliases (overridable/extendable via `~/.flow/shortcuts.json`):

`pl` play · `sh` search · `ls` list · `lk` like · `ul` unlike · `dl` download
· `dl-d` delete · `re` rename · `rd` radio · `sw` switch · `hl` help ·
`cf` config · `ex` exit · `svn` savan · `svn-s` savan-s · `plist` playlist

Manage them inside Flow with the `short` command:

```bash
short                     # list all shortcuts
short add <key> <cmd>     # add or update an alias
short remove <idx>        # remove by list index
short <idx> <new_cmd>     # update by index
```

## Commands

These work in both the interactive prompt and shell mode. `search` shows
results with indices; `play <index>` plays a result by number, and after a
download the matching index can be used the same way.

| Command                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `play <name, index, or liked>` | Play a song by name or search-result number; offline also supports `play liked` and `play all`. `-m` plays a ticked selection as a queue                                                                                          |
| `search <query>`               | Search YouTube (online) or the local library (offline); `-dm` downloads a ticked selection                                                                                                                                        |
| `list`                         | List the local library (offline; alias `ls`)                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `savan <name>`                 | Play a song from JioSaavn (online)                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `savan-s <query>`              | Search JioSaavn (online)                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `radio <name> [index]`         | Radio mix (online) or shuffle-loop library (offline). Bare `radio` shuffles everything; a name seeds the loop with that song. `-p` saves as playlist                                                                              |
| `like` / `unlike`              | Like/unlike the current song; liked songs are saved to the library and played with `play liked`                                                                                                                                   |
| `download <query or index>`    | Save a streamed song (online; `-f <format>` picks opus/m4a/mp3/webm). Add `-m` to tick and download several                                                                                                                       |
| `delete <name or index>`       | Delete a downloaded song (alias: `dl-d`)                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `rename <name or index>`       | Rename a downloaded song (offline; alias: `re`). You are then asked for the new name. An index is the number in the `list` output (ascending by name) and the prompt repeats it                                                   |
| `lang <tag>`                   | Play every downloaded song with that language tag (offline). One word — `hindi`, `punjabi`, `telugu`, ... — set when the song was downloaded. Partial words work (`lang pun`); `-s` shuffles                                      |
| `artist <name>`                | Play every song by that artist. Offline plays your downloads, online plays the YouTube results whose title credits the artist (falling back to the current track's artist). Partial words work; `-s` shuffles (alias: `ar`)       |
| `tags [scan \| apply]`         | List the language and artist tags in your library. `tags scan` asks YouTube for each downloaded song's metadata and writes `~/.flow/tags-preview.tsv` (nothing is saved); `tags apply` writes that reviewed file into the library |
| `playlist <sub>`               | Manage playlists — see below                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `switch`                       | Toggle between online and offline mode                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `config [target [value]]`      | Change settings; run bare for an interactive wizard                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `short`                        | Show/update command shortcuts                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `check`                        | Check all dependencies                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `summary`                      | Play statistics and the ranked per-song table — see below                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `export [-p <path>]`           | Copy downloaded songs (tagged) to `~/Downloads`, or to `<path>`                                                                                                                                                                   |

### summary

`summary` reports what you've been playing. Play counts come from
`~/.flow/library.db` and cover **both** online and offline playback; the
online totals come from `~/.flow/history.db`.

```bash
flow summary                          # stats card + a 7-day bar chart
flow summary -l                       # the ranked per-song table
flow summary -l -s artist --top 50    # sort by artist, 50 rows
flow summary -c                       # clear the online play history
```

| Flag        | Description                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-l`        | Show the per-song table instead of the stats card         |
| `-s <sort>` | Table sort: `plays` (default), `recent`, `name`, `artist` |
| `--top <N>` | Rows to show in the table (default: 20)                   |
| `-c`        | Clear the logged online plays (`history.db`)              |

`-c` only empties the play timeline — the `song_count` totals in
`library.db` are untouched.

In shell mode `flow summary …` takes the same flags. As a one-shot flag,
`flow --summary …` also accepts the long `--sort <key>` and `--top <N>`
spellings:

```bash
flow --summary -l --sort recent --top 10
```

The **web History panel** shows the other half of the data: an online-only
timeline you can sort by _newest_, _oldest_, _most played_ or _least played_
and filter to today / 7 days / 30 days. The split is deliberate — the CLI
ranks a per-song table (a terminal is bad at a long event log), the web panel
sorts an event stream (a scrollable column is bad at aggregates).

### lang / artist / tags

Every download stores two tags in `~/.flow/library.db`: a one-word **language**
(`hindi`, `punjabi`, `telugu`, …) and the **artist**. They come from YouTube's
own metadata — its language field, else the script the title is written in, and
the credited artist (never the channel name). Everything else in a music video's
title and description — credits, hashtags, `(Official Video)` — is thrown away.

```bash
flow tags                     # what you can play by right now
flow lang hindi               # every hindi download, ascending by name
flow lang pun -s              # partial word, shuffled
flow artist karan             # every Karan Aujla song, ascending by name
flow artist "Arijit Singh"    # matches on part of the name, not just the start
```

`lang` is offline-only, since it filters your downloads. `artist` works in both
modes: offline it filters your library the same way; online there is no library
to filter, so it keeps the search results whose **title** credits the artist and,
when none of them do, falls back to the artist of the track that is playing.

Songs downloaded before tags existed have none. `tags scan` asks YouTube about
each of them, one at a time, and writes what it finds to
`~/.flow/tags-preview.tsv` — one row per song, nothing saved to the library
until you say so:

```bash
flow tags scan     # writes ~/.flow/tags-preview.tsv
$EDITOR ~/.flow/tags-preview.tsv    # read it, fix or drop rows you disagree with
flow tags apply    # writes the file into library.db
```

`apply` sets the language tag and only fills in an artist where there is none,
so it never replaces an artist you already have. Add `all` (`flow tags scan all`)
to re-scan songs that already have a language tag.

### export

`export` copies every song in `~/.flow/downloads` somewhere you can reach it
with a file manager, and writes the library's metadata into each copy.

```bash
flow export                    # -> ~/Downloads
flow export -p ~/Music/flow    # -> anywhere else
```

| Flag        | Description                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p <path>` | Destination directory (created if missing). Defaults to `~/Downloads` |

Each copy is named after the song — `Never Gonna Give You Up.webm`, not
`dQw4w9WgXcQ.webm` — and tagged with the title, artist and album from
`library.db`. A song the library has no title for is tagged with its own file
name. Cover art is attached where the format allows it, and the audio itself
is never re-encoded.

Re-running `export` refreshes the files it already wrote instead of creating
`… (2).webm` copies, so a song that changed in the library gets re-tagged in
place.

Tagging needs `ffmpeg` (`flow check` will tell you if it's missing). Without
it the songs are still copied, just untagged.

### Playlist subcommands

`playlist` (alias `plist`): `create` · `add` · `remove` · `list` · `play` ·
`rename` · `move` · `duplicate` · `merge` · `sort` · `clear` · `dedupe` ·
`info` · `export` · `import` · `download`

```bash
flow playlist create roadtrip
flow playlist add roadtrip "some song"
flow playlist list
flow playlist play roadtrip
flow playlist export roadtrip   # writes roadtrip.m3u to ~/Downloads
flow playlist import songs.m3u  # name defaults to the file name
flow playlist download roadtrip # download all YouTube tracks in it
```

`liked` is a reserved playlist name.

## flow-min: plain, non-interactive

`flow-min` is a fourth front end over the same player and library, with every
interactive affordance removed: no colour, no spinner, no prompts. It is for
the places where a prompt is a bug — an ssh session on a terminal with no
colour, a pipe, a cron job, or an agent driving the player.

```bash
flow-min status                     one line of player state
flow-min play "karan aujla 52 bars" search YouTube and play, then return
flow-min play-off 52 bars           play a downloaded song
flow-min search "arijit singh"      list the results as 1..N
flow-min play 2                     play row 2 of that search
flow-min --json search "arijit singh" | jq '.[0].video_id'
flow-min lang punjabi -s            play every downloaded punjabi song, shuffled
flow-min next                       skip, from any terminal
```

`search` remembers the rows it printed, so a bare `play <index>` picks one of
them instead of searching again — no prompt in between, and nothing to copy
by hand. With no saved search it exits `1` and says so; a number past the end
reports the range.

The commands are the part of the table above that never needs a conversation:
`status`, `play`, `play-off`, `resume`, `search`, `stop`, `pause`, `next`,
`prev`, `seek`, `seek-back`, `list`, `liked`, `like`, `unlike`, `download`,
`delete`, `rename`, `lang`, `artist`, `radio`, `radio-off`, `tags`, `lyrics`,
`playlist`, `history`, `stats`. The conversational ones — `config`, `switch`,
`summary`, `export`, the shortcuts and the dependency check — stay with
`flow`.

Three rules:

- **One line by default, one JSON document with `--json`** — before or after
  the command: `flow-min --json status`, `flow-min status --json`.
- **It never asks.** Where the shell prompts you for the new name, `flow-min`
  takes `rename <song> --to <new name>`; where a name matches several songs
  it prints the candidates and exits `2` so the caller can retry with a
  longer one.
- **It never blocks by accident.** Playback detaches and prints the new pid;
  add `--fg` to keep it in the foreground.

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` failure, `2` ambiguous input, `130` interrupted.

```console
$ flow-min delete bars
52 Bars  /home/me/.flow/downloads/4DfVxVeqk2o.opus
Achha Ji  /home/me/.flow/downloads/ZN_XrB_St-8.opus
flow-min: 2 songs match 'bars'; be more specific
$ echo $?
2
```

`flow` and `flow-min` share `~/.flow` completely: a song downloaded by one is
listed by the other, and either can control a player the other started.
